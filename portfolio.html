                <br>
                <p>As part of my associate degree in Internet of Things, I completed a 4-month internship at Absolem,</p>
                <p>a company specialized in laser technology.</p>
                <p>There, I contributed to various projects and learned a great deal about many different areas of the industry.</p>

                    <h3>Tasks performed:</h3>
                    <p>Writing Python code.</p>
                    <p>Designing PCBs for SBC (single board computer) and ADC(analog digital converter).</p>
                    <p>Installing hardware.</p>
                    <p>Setting up Docker containers for the Python script,</p>
                    <p>Influx database, and Grafana visualization.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Project:</h3>
                    <p>For my first assignment, I demonstrated the possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the laser lab.</p>
                    <p>Several laser setups in the lab generate a lot of heat. This heat is regulated using a water cooler.</p>
                    <p>If the temperature becomes too high, the lasers automatically shut down to prevent overheating.</p>
                    <p>This slows down the work of colleagues, who then need to wait for the system to cool down.</p>
                    <p>The Lab-Sens project collects data from the machines, allowing us to identify which setups are overheating the cooling system,</p>
                    <p>and eventually how factors like temperature, humidity, and vibrations affect test results.</p>
                    <p>This project shows how IoT can solve practical problems, improve workflow, and increase lab efficiency.</p>

                    <h3>Project:</h3>
                    <p>For a project for chip manufacturer ASML, we used an industrial computer to control an entire setup,</p>
                    <p>consisting of various modules such as the laser, several safety switches, and the cooler.</p>
                    <p>My task was to help develop the software for the laser component of this phase.</p>
                    <p>This meant I had to learn a new programming language,</p>
                    <p>and use a standard software template that Absolem applies to machine programming.</p>
                    <p>I also contributed to the design of a modular structure, making it easier to program and deploy future lasers,</p>
                    <p>and enabling the machine to be reused across different setups.</p>
                    <p>By making the laser module easy to replace or swap,</p>
                    <p>the design of new systems and machines becomes much more flexible and efficient.</p>

                    <p>At Absolem, I helped replace a laser that had reached the end of its life cycle.</p>
                    <p>This laser was used to produce test capsules for leak detection in the pharmaceutical industry,</p>
                    <p>but broke down before the replacement was ready.</p>
                    <p>Since the customer expected several capsules each week, development of the new laser had to speed up quickly.</p>
                    <p>I was asked to assemble the new laser controller,</p>
                    <p>which was built into a 19-inch rack cabinet that provided power and control for the laser.</p>
                    <p>After this, I performed a similar task for another experimental setup.</p>
                    <p>The controllers were assembled using schematics drawn by colleagues,</p>
                    <p>which allowed us to discuss and apply changes to simplify the assembly process.</p>

                    <h3>Project:</h3>
                    <p>At Absolem, we’re working on a system to extend the shelf life of medication by storing it in a controlled atmosphere of nitrogen and CO2.</p>
                    <p>The setup first creates a vacuum, then fills it with the precise gas mixture.</p>
                    <p>Since the shelf life heavily depends on this ratio,</p>
                    <p>it’s crucial to accurately measure the nitrogen/CO2 mix while filling the vacuum.</p>
                    <p>My job was to select a CO2 sensor that could measure the ratio as early as possible in the process.</p>
                    <p>The chosen sensor can start measuring from 0.5 bar.</p>
                    <p>After ordering the sensor and preparing the necessary hardware to process and read the signal,</p>
                    <p>the project was temporarily paused so I could work on the laser controllers.</p>
                    <p>We can now perform measurements, amplify the signal with an op-amp, and read it via an AD converter.</p>
                    <p>What still needs to be done is correctly interpreting the signal using a multiplier factor and calculating this value.</p>

                    <h3>Project:</h3>
                    <p>Another assignment I took on was designing a LED driver for leak detection.</p>
                    <p>The driver was meant to shine high-power LEDs through pipes,</p>
                    <p>allowing a special camera to detect light on the outside.</p>
                    <p>For this, I designed a custom PCB to power the SMD LED.</p>
                    <p>I completed the final design with help from a colleague. Because the high-power LED generates a lot of heat,</p>
                    <p>I opted for an aluminum PCB for better heat dissipation.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, due to a supplier error, a plastic-finished PCB was delivered instead,</p>
                    <p>causing significant delays and making it unusable for this project.</p>
                    <p>Luckily, the schematics weren’t lost.</p>
                    <p>SMD LEDs are becoming more common in projects, and the designs can easily be adapted for other LEDs and setups.</p>
