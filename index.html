                        Well, you’ve landed on the homepage of MBlab!
                        This website is my (Mathias Boeckx) way of sharing my experiences, projects, and interests with the world.
                        It’s also a way to give some kind of personal branding to the more serieus work I do.
                        In doing so, the first steps toward partial self-employment are already taken and it gives me a cool logo to stick on my projects!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>

                <div id="professionals">
                    <h2>Professionals</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you ended up here for professional reasons, you can download my CV using the link below.
                        If you're more interested in my projects and experience, I’d recommend heading over to the ‘Portfolio’ page.
                        There, you’ll find everything from internships and school projects to the things I build and explore in my free time. 
                        And if you’d like to get a better idea of who I am outside of work, feel free to check out the ‘About’ page too.

                    <p>
                        Of course, everyone is welcome on this website!
                        Use it to gather ideas and inspiration for your own projects.
                        The more we share our experiences and knowledge, the smarter we all become!
                        On the ‘About’ page, you’ll find my hobbies and other interests. On the ‘Portfolio’ page, you’ll see the projects I’ve worked on.
                        I hope you learn something here or find a cool project for your own MBlab!
