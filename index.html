                    <h2>Where are you?</h2>
                    <p>Well, you’ve landed on the homepage of MBlab!</p>
                    <p>This website is my (Mathias Boeckx) way of sharing my experiences, projects, and interests with the world.</p>
                    <p>It’s also a way to give some kind of personal branding to the more serieus work I do.</p>
                    <p>In doing so, the first steps toward partial self-employment are already taken and it gives me a cool logo to stick on my projects!</p>

                <div id="proffessionals">
                    <h2>Professionals</h2>
                    <p>For those who ended up here for professional reasons:</p>
                    <p>I’d recommend heading straight over to the ‘Portfolio’ page.</p>
                    <p>There, you'll find my projects, internship work, and more info on the educational projects I explore in my free time.</p>
                    <p>After that, feel free to check out my ‘About’ page as well.</p>
                    <p>It’s a chance to get to know me in a non-professional context, if that’s something you're interested in too.</p>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <div id="non-professionals">
                    <h2>Non-professionals</h2>
                    <p>Of course, everyone is welcome on this website!</p>
                    <p>Use it to gather ideas and inspiration for your own projects.</p>
                    <p>The more we share our experiences and knowledge, the smarter we all become!</p>
                    <p>On the ‘About’ page, you’ll find my hobbies and other interests. On the ‘Portfolio’ page, you’ll see the projects I’ve worked on.</p>
                    <p>I hope you learn something here or find a cool project for your own MBlab!</p>
