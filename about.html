                    <h3>Bachelor degree</h3>
                    <p>Right now, I'm studying for a bachelor's degree in Cloud & Cybersecurity at Thomas More in Geel.</p>
                    <p>This course teaches you how to set up your own cloud infrastructure, automate it, and secure it properly.</p>
                    <p>I chose this path because I think security is often overlooked or only considered afterwards.</p>
                    <p>With this degree, I’m making sure that’s not the case for me, and that I’ve got the knowledge</p>
                    <p>to build security in right from the start in all my future projects and jobs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Associate degree</h3>
                    <p>Before starting my bachelor’s, I completed an associate degree in IoT (Internet of Things).</p>
                    <p>This course mainly focused on collecting and processing data, and controlling actuators with microcontrollers.</p>
                    <p>What I found most interesting was the mix of hardware and software.</p>
                    <p>I really enjoy working with electronics, and when you connect that with software,</p>
                    <p> you can bring things to life pretty quickly.</p>
                    <p>I finished this degree with the highest distinction, something I’m definitely proud of.</p>

                    <h3>Climbing</h3>
                    <p>My main hobby is climbing, it's something I really enjoy and try to do as often as I can.</p>
                    <p>What I love about climbing is that it's not just a physical puzzle, but also a mental challenge.</p>
                    <p>You can’t climb without feeling fear. You have to learn how to manage that fear and keep going,</p>
                    <p>while making the right judgment about when things are worth doing and when it’s getting too dangerous.</p>   
                    <br>                
                    <h3>Surfing</h3>
                    <p>When I’ve had a tough or exhausting period, I try to go surfing.</p>
                    <p>With surfing, the mental challenge is a bit less intense and the daily rhythm</p>
                    <p>slows down, which gives me more time to really relax.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Traveling</h3>
                    <p>Like most people my age, I enjoy traveling. I love discovering new places, trying different foods, and experiencing new cultures.</p>
                    <p>Most of the countries I’ve visited are in Europe, except for Tanzania. I went there during middle school for a volunteer project.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Books</h3>
                    <p>Another thing I really enjoy in my free time is reading.</p>
                    <p>One of the first books I read was 'Dune'. People who know it will understand it’s a heavy book to start with,</p>
                    <p>but luckily, the story grabbed me right away and pulled me in.</p>
                    <p>After that, I started looking for other 'space operas' and ended up reading 'The Three-Body Problem' and 'Hyperion'.</p>
                    <p>I found all three of these series absolutely amazing, and I’d recommend them to anyone interested in the genre.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since I started spending quite a bit of time reading, I thought it might be a good idea to also pick up something more educational now and then.</p>
                    <p>That’s why I also started reading non-fiction books like 'Sapiens' from Yuval Noah Harari.</p>
